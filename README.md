## Description
- 3 credits
- Prerequisites: CSCI 232 and CSCI 246.

This course covers formal languages, theory, automata, Turing Machines, computability, the Church-Turing thesis, computational complexity, and NP-completeness

## Course information
This course meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 11:00 a.m.–11:50 a.m. in Reid 104. Course meetings consist of a combination of lectures, in-class activities, and quizzes. We will use Discord as the primary method of communication, and course information will be posted on d2l and github.

## Course resources

### Textbook
* Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Michael Sipser, Third Edition.
* This book is needed for this course. I would expect all the students in this class to read it.
* Some of the homework questions will be directly from this book.

# Instructor
- Adiesha Liyanage
  * Office hours: TBD

## Course Assistants

## Grading
Since this is a theory course majority of you grade comes from assignments, tests and a final.
You will be graded on the following:
- Assignments 42% : There will be at least 6 assignments. I will either drop the lowest grade assignment or replace the lowest grade assignment with the highest grade assignment.
- Pop-up quizzes 8% : These are lightly graded, there will be around 12 pop-up tests, best 8 will be counted towards the final grade.
- In class tests 30% : 3 In-class tests, they will be announced at least one week ahead.
- Final (optional) 20%

The final is optional. If you are happy with the grades of the 3 in-class tests, then the final grade will be the average (in percentage) of the 3 in-class tests multiplied by 20. If you are not happy with the average of your in-class test, then you could choose to take the optional final. **The optional final cannot be taken early.** 
Note that quizzes are not an attendance counting, however, they will be graded lightly.

At the end of the semester, final grades will be determined based on your overall performance on assignments, quizzes, tests and the final exam.

## Course outcomes
- Understand the elementary concepts, proofs and techniques on finite state automata and regular languages.
- Understand the elementary concepts, proofs and techniques on pushdown automata and context-free languages.
- Understand the elementary concepts, proofs and techniques on computability theory.
- Be able to do simple mapping reductions.
- Understand the elementary concepts, proofs and techniques on complexity theory and NP-completeness.
- Be able to do simple polynomial reductions.
- Know how to handle intractable problems with heuristic methods.

## Accommodations
If you have a documented disability and need or might need accommodations, please reach out the Office of Disability Services as soon as possible and then talk to me.

## SmartyCats tutoring and other help
- [SmartyCats website](https://www.montana.edu/aycss/success/smartycats/)
- [CS Department Tutoring Center](https://www.cs.montana.edu/student-success-center.html). Free help from upper division undergraduate and graduate students.

## Collaboration policy
- For your homework assignments, you may discuss the problem with your peers.
- However, you are not allowed to copy proofs from your peers, use generative AI to complete your assignments.
- If you use resources from the internet to solve problems, you MUST cite them.

Failure to abide by these rules will result in everyone involved being reported to the Dean of Students and receiving an F for the course.

## Latex
- Assignments MUST be completed using LaTeX and submitted as a PDF. There will be no exceptions to this rule—grading handwritten proofs is extremely difficult, so I must enforce this for the sake of the TA's sanity.
- You can create a free [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account, which is a free platform for editing and compiling complex LaTeX documents online. This is very similar to Google Docs but with LaTeX.
- Basic [Overleaf latex](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) tutorials.
- If you do not know the LaTeX code for a specific mathematical symbol, you can use the following [website](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html): https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html Draw the symbol that you want; it will provide you the necessary code for that symbol and the packages that you have to import.
- Using LaTeX for mathematical writing is infinitely easier than using Word or handwriting the solutions once you get the hang of it.

## Late policy
- You are responsible for any announcements about assignments made in class, on Discord, on D2L, and here on the course website. You must pay attention to these announcements.
- You can submit as many times as you would like, the TA will only grade your last submission.
- If you submit within 24 hours of the due date, you get 20% off of the score you earn. If you submit within two days of the due date you get 40% off. Otherwise, no points are possible.

## Missing Tests
If you are going to miss a test, you need to discuss this prior to missing the class. Serious illness or a serious family emergency are valid reasons requiring an accommodation, but other reasons are not (travel, employement schedule conflict).
